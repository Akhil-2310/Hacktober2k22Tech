        Rishi Sunak should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessors in trying to please his party
At a time when ethnonationalist and majoritarian far-right parties are on the ascent in many democracies across the world,
 the rise of Rishi Sunak, a man of colour and a practising Hindu, to the premiership of the predominantly white, Christian U.K.,
  has great symbolic value. While his election as Britain’s first non-white Prime Minister points to the readiness of Conservative 
  MPs to look beyond the racial and religious barriers for a solution to the crisis both party and country are in, his victory was
   particularly welcomed by sections in India, who see some historical fulfilment in a man of Indian origin ruling over India’s 
   former colonial rulers. But the power of symbolism is limited when it is tested with the hard realities of the day. 
   In fact, the very circumstances that led to his rise should themselves serve as a warning for the new leader. 
   He is the fifth Prime Minister since the Tories’ victory in the 2010 general elections, and the third in the last two months.
    Liz Truss, his immediate predecessor, had also promised to revive the economy but exited in seven 
    weeks amid a hostile market reaction to her policy measures and an open revolt among the Tory MPs.
